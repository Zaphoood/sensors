## Usage

### Running edge flip

By default, the example triangulation of the sphere will be loaded from `examples/triangulation.txt`.
Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to run the edge flip algorithm in order to obtain a Delaunay triangulation.

Press <kbd>E</kbd> in order to export the current triangulation to a file.

### Creating triangulations

To create a triangulation, first load a list of vectors from a file by chaning the path of the triangulation to load.
Then, select three nodes at a time (using <kbd>Shift</kbd>-click) and press <kbd>F</kbd> to fill the triangle in.
Finally, export the triangulation by pressing <kbd>E</kbd>.

Note that currently there is no way to delete faces.
